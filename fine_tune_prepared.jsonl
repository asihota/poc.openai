{"prompt":"When the offence was committed, the applicant and the complainant had been separated for about 12 months having been married for about 20 years. They had agreed that the house should be sold. The applicant had learnt that the complainant had formed a relationship with another man. Despite the lengthy separation, the applicant became very angry about this relationship. On the night in question, at a time between finishing work at one place and commencing work at his other workplace, he decided to go home, where he collected a baseball bat from the garage and went to the room where his wife was sleeping. He left the complainant’s room before returning soon afterwards. This time, using both hands, he struck a blow with the baseball bat to his wife’s skull as she slept.","completion":" Applicant and the complainant had been separated for about 12 months\nApplicant and the complainant had been married for about 20 years.\nApplicant and the complainant agreed the house should be sold.\nThe applicant had learnt that the complainant had formed a relationship with another man.\nDespite the lengthy separation, the applicant became very angry about this relationship.\nOn the night in question, at a time between finishing work at one place and commencing work at his other workplace, the applicant decided to go home, where he collected a baseball bat from the garage and went to the room where his wife was sleeping.\nThe applicant left the complainant’s room before returning soon afterwards.

{"prompt":"According to the evidence of a neurosurgeon, the blow to the complainant caused significant and ongoing injuries which, if left untreated, would have probably caused her death. Urgent surgical intervention was required to elevate and wash out a compound contaminated depressed skull fracture and to evacuate an acute subdural haematoma. In the opinion of another medical specialist, the complainant was left with a permanent neurological deficit, a residual facial droop and a reduced range of movements to one side of her face. A further consequence of this offence is that she now suffers post traumatic epilepsy, resulting in seizures which she seeks to suppress with anti-epileptic medication. It is probable that her epilepsy will be permanent. She also has consequential psychological problems which have damaged her relationship with her three children. She is continually tired and fatigued and because of her seizures she is unable to drive. She has lost the ability to work. She has lost the hearing in one ear. She has difficulty in conducting conversations.","completion":"  No events found END"}
{"prompt":" The applicant made to police officers what the sentencing judge described as \"unguarded admissions\". In December 2014 the applicant sent the complainant a Christmas card apologising for what he had done. The sentencing judge remarked that this remorse was also reflected in a letter which the applicant had addressed to his Honour.","completion":" No events found END"}
{"prompt":" In the course of the sentencing hearing, the learned sentencing judge discussed with counsel the sequence of the five offences. He accepted the prosecution’s submission that the offences occurred on more than one occasion. Among other things, the sentencing judge referred to the complainant’s report of an occasion when the applicant called her back in the room, took his and her clothes off and she \"knew what was coming\".","completion":" No events found END"}
{"prompt":" The complainant reported the applicant’s offending to her mother. Her mother told her not to tell anyone. Later, and with reluctance due to the \"pinkie promise\" obtained by the applicant to not tell anyone and her mother’s advice that if she told anyone her father would get into trouble, the complainant disclosed the offending.","completion":" The complainant reported the applicant's offending to her mother.\nHer mother told her not to tell anyone.

{"prompt":" the emotional damage caused to the complainant.\nAs to the last matter, the complainant’s age and the fact that the perpetrator was her father must have proved traumatic. The sentencing judge referred to a passage in her evidence when she spoke about crying when she was on her own. By the time of the second police interview she was in foster care and felt safe.\n The prosecutor noted the limited number of comparable cases of multiple sexual offences perpetrated against an offender’s child that do not involve the offence of maintaining.","completion":" No events found END"}
{"prompt":" The prosecutor submitted that the top of the range probably did not extend to 10 years or more with an automatic SVO declaration. According to the prosecution, absent the 80 per cent parole requirement of an SVO declaration, a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment would have been appropriate. The prosecutor submitted that the sentence might extend very close to 10 years, and it was a question of how to structure the sentence.\n Reliance was placed upon the fact that the applicant’s actions had certainly destroyed the family unit as it had existed. It almost certainly negated any relationship between the complainant and the applicant in the future. The complainant had been placed in the care of the department for two years following the disclosures to her mother, but had been returned to her mother by the date of sentencing. With whom she would live in the long term was uncertain.","completion":" No events found END"}
{"prompt":" Counts 1 and 2 occurred at a railway station at approximately 6 pm when the applicant approached and followed a woman who had alighted from the train. He grabbed her around the throat. There was a struggle in which her necklace broke and her clothing was torn. During this the applicant came in to contact with her breast. The applicant was scared off by her screams and ran away. He was chased by two men who caught up with him, a struggle ensued and the applicant got away. The applicant caught a taxi home and police used this to trace him.

The complainant and the appellant then sat down on a bed which was located adjacent to a sofa in the lounge area of the unit. As they did so, the appellant picked up the complainant’s telephone and read a message sent to the complainant on Facebook. The complainant had not yet seen the message.

{"prompt":"  The appellant submitted the verdict of the jury was unreasonable as the complainant’s evidence that she submitted to the acts of intercourse out of fear following the earlier assaults had to be viewed against the background that there was no evidence those assaults were in any way related to a request or demand by the appellant for sex. There was also no evidence their prior relationship involved the use of violence to dominate or overcome the complainant’s exercise of free will in respect of sexual intercourse. It was never suggested by the complainant she relayed her lack of consent to the appellant.","completion":" No events found END"}
